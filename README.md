Noise Level Detection and Sanitization Status functionality on an M5Stack Core2 using Arduino

This code was developed during the hieght of the pandemic, to be run on an M5Stack Core2 (a small, handheld portable device) and be potentially deployed in a library. The device displays the sanisation status, which could be toggled using the touch screen. In case the noise levels were above an experimentally determined value, the device displays a warning to be quiet. In addition, the device is capable of communicating the noise level and sanitisation status to another computer using a web server.
